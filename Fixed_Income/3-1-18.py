Hi favorite guitarist is john petrucci <- lol

Valuation of bonds with embedded options

call options decrease in value with an increase in i rates
    put options are the opposite

All else constant:
    an upward sloping yield curve causes a lower interest rate
    downward sloping y curve implies lower future rates which makes the call option more valueable


For a bond with risk, shift the entire tree up by the oas
    When valuing any risky security
