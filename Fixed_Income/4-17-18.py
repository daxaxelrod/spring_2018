Debt Payoff = Long RF security + Short put
            = -Value of rf + Value of the put

Determinants of credit risk
    Value of the put = f(...)

The payoff from a debt contract is equal to rf debt + a short put on the firm

Determinants of credit risk
    Volitilty of assets goes up, so does value of the put
    Fv of debt goes up, the firm is borrowing more so the leverage presents a higher risk to the firm
        So the value of the put goes up
    asset value goes down, value of put goes up
        If the stock price goes down the value of the put goes up

Distance to Default model -- p(d)
    Assumption: Firm defaults if Market value of asssets < Fv Debt
    
    Just the area of the z-score that the face value of the debt is away from the expected value of assets
    Determinants of distance to default
        FV debt
        Std Dev - Volitility of assets
        Asset Value
