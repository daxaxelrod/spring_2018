Goes over the hw
Discount margin is the percentage you add to the discount rate (index + spread) that matches the price based upon the required rate of return investors require
    The higher the Discount margin, the lower the price ends up being because cashflows are discounted more

Spread: ytm minus closest maturity government rate
G-Spread: YTM minus maturity matches government rate
I-Spread: YTM minus maturity matched swap rate (generally fixed for variable interest rate swaps)
Z-Spread: spread over current index

IOS: Lets use an example
    Start with a straight bond with price p
    Then look at a bond with a call option
    the price of the bond with the call option is <= the first bond
    Spread call >= spread of normal bond

    #callable bond
    OIS = Spread of the call - call option value = Spread

    #puttable bond
    OAS = Spread of put + put option value = Spread
