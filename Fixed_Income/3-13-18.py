Going over interest rate trees again.
    Specifically the callable bond
        Callable bond is the same as the tree except when the bond option will be executed
        just replace the value with 100

    Price of a callable bond = price of straight bond - value of the call
    Use 4 decimal places in hw 4

You can extend the tree model to other securities
    Valueing a capped floater
        Floating rate bond with an upper bound on the interest rate
        the interest rate in shared nodes are path dependent
        the price of a floater with no cap will always be par at the coupon reset rate

    Valueing a convertable bond
        Just take the straight value of the bond
        And include the price of an option with a similar maturity and strike price
