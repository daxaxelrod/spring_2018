Went over the homework and a mini quiz

Going over the PV of a bond that has a portion that has already elapsed

PV(t) = PV * (1+r)**(elapsed time/ Total bond time)

PV full = PV flat + accrued interest
^dirty    ^clean     ^ PMT * t/T

Most of the time you see the clean price
When you actually pay, you pay the dirty price

If you're ' a bond investor and want to find the YTM of a bond
